Supplemental Figure 1. Biplot of PC1 (representing 84.8% of the total variance) versus PC3 (representing 4.35% of the total variance) for all 85 vessels showing samples distinguished by ware type with 90% confidence ellipses overlaid. 

Supplemental Figure 2. Biplot of LD1 (91.2% of the variance) versus LD2 (8.77% of the total variance) for all 85 vessels showing samples distinguished by ware. 

Supplemental Figure 3. Dendrogram showing results of hierarchical clustering analysis, with the samples distinguished by ware.
